A JavaScript project that calculates the ingredients needed to make a specific number of cups of Kenyan Chai.

- Water
- Milk
- Tea Leaves (Majani)
- Sugar (Sukari)

## Standard Chai Recipe (per cup)
- Water: 200 ml  
- Milk: 50 ml

# Boda Boda Fare Estimator

A JavaScript program to estimate the total cost of a boda boda ride based on distance traveled.

## Description

This project calculates the fare for a Kenyan boda boda (motorbike taxi) ride using basic input from the user. It applies a standard base fare and adds a charge per kilometer.

**Fare Rules:**
- **Base Fare:** KES 50
- **Per Kilometer:** KES 15/km

Example:
> If you travel 5 kilometers, your total fare will be:
> - Base Fare: KES 50  
> - Distance Fare: KES 75  
> - **Total: KES 125**

The program includes input validation.

# Transaction Fee Estimator

A simple JavaScript program that estimates transaction fees based on the amount a user wishes to send. This project demonstrates basic user input handling, conditional logic, and output formatting in the console.

## Project Description

This calculator estimates how much money will be debited from your account when sending a given amount, based on a simplified fee structure:

- **Base Fee:** 1.5% of the amount to send.
- **Minimum Fee:** KES 10
- **Maximum Fee:** KES 70

If 1.5% of the amount is:
- Less than KES 10 → you’ll be charged KES 10.
- More than KES 70 → you’ll be charged KES 70.
- Otherwise → you’ll be charged the exact 1.5%.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` or run the JavaScript file in your browser console or a Node environment.
2. You'll be prompted: Karibu! How many cups of Chai Bora would you like to make? || Unafika wapi Mkubwa? Kilometer ngapi?: || Unatuma Ngapi? (KES):
3. Enter the required number.
4. The estimated result is displayed in the console.
